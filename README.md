# Data-Cleaning

About the project:

I have created the data cleaning project. I was able to upload data, transform with SQL queries in order to obtain clean data ready for further analyze using more complex queries.

The project presents the following cleaning queries:

-- Removing trailing spaces from the "Employee Name" and updating table with the correct value;

-- Removing dash from the "Name";

-- Creating new text column for the "Job Type";

-- Extracting the "Job Type";

-- Getting the "Cost Centre" from the "ID" column;

-- Extracting 5 characters from the "ID" column, starting in position 3;

-- 	Converting datetime to date type 105;

-- Getting the name of the City from the column "Work location";

-- Two ways of removing and replacing a character. Removing "Remote" from the City column and replacing with '-';
